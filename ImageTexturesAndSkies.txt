## UV Coordinates
Same logic as ray tracing
    Set UV at vertices and interpolate

## Texture Class
pygame surface of image
texture reference

load and upload texture

## Uploading Data
creates pixel to data and send to texture buffer
Can auto make a mipmap based on bind target

MAG_FILTER
If texture smaller than surface, need to upscale

MIN_FILTER
If texture is larger than surface, need to mipmap

UV and ST
UV between 0 and 1
ST for surface coordinate

Sampling
upload data to texture famebks
limietd number o ftexture youa -f  bf
activateTexture assigns texture to what it's associated with
